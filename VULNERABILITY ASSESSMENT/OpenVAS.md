---

[OpenVAS](https://openvas.org/), by Greenbone Networks, is a publicly available vulnerability scanner. Greenbone Networks has an entire Vulnerability Manager, part of which is the OpenVAS scanner. Greenbone's Vulnerability Manager is also open to the public and free to use. OpenVAS has the capabilities to perform network scans, including authenticated and unauthenticated testing.

- **Note:** The VM provided in the `OpenVAS Skills Assessment` section has OpenVAS pre-installed and the targets running. You can go to that section and start the VM and use OpenVAS throughout the module, which can be accessed at `https://< IP >:8080`. The OpenVAS credentials are: `htb-student`:`HTB_@cademy_student!`. You may also use these credentials to SSH into the target VM to configure OpenVAS.
