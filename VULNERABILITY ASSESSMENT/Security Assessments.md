Every organization must perform different types of `Security assessments` on their `networks`, `computers`, and `applications` at least every so often. The primary purpose of most types of security assessments is to find and confirm vulnerabilities are present, so we can work to `patch`, `mitigate`, or `remove` them.

## Vulnerability Assessment

`Vulnerability assessments` are appropriate for all organizations and networks. A vulnerability assessment is based on a particular security standard, and compliance with these standards is analyzed (e.g., going through a checklist).

## Penetration Test

Here at `Hack The Box`, we love penetration tests, otherwise known as pentests. Our labs and many of our other Academy courses focus on pentesting.

They're called penetration tests because testers conduct them to determine if and how they can penetrate a network. A pentest is a type of simulated cyber attack, and pentesters conduct actions that a threat actor may perform to see if certain kinds of exploits are possible. The key difference between a pentest and an actual cyber attack is that the former is done with the full legal consent of the entity being pentested. Whether a pentester is an employee or a third-party contractor, they will need to sign a lengthy legal document with the target company that describes what they're allowed to do and what they're not allowed to do.

- `Black box` pentesting is done with no knowledge of a network's configuration or applications. Typically a tester will either be given network access (or an ethernet port and have to bypass Network Access Control NAC) and nothing else (requiring them to perform their own discovery for IP addresses) if the pentest is internal, or nothing more than the company name if the pentest is from an external standpoint. This type of pentesting is usually conducted by third parties from the perspective of an `external` attacker. Often the customer will ask the pentester to show them discovered internal/external IP addresses/network ranges so they can confirm ownership and note down any hosts that should be considered out-of-scope.

- `Grey box` pentesting is done with a little bit of knowledge of the network they're testing, from a perspective equivalent to an `employee` who doesn't work in the IT department, such as a `receptionist` or `customer service agent`. The customer will typically give the tester in-scope network ranges or individual IP addresses in a grey box situation.

- `White box` pentesting is typically conducted by giving the penetration tester full access to all systems, configurations, build documents, etc., and source code if web applications are in-scope. The goal here is to discover as many flaws as possible that would be difficult or impossible to discover blindly in a reasonable amount of time.

- `Application` pentesters assess web applications, thick-client applications, APIs, and mobile applications. They will often be well-versed in source code review and able to assess a given web application from a black box or white box standpoint (typically a secure code review).

> `Physical` pentesters try to leverage physical security weaknesses and breakdowns in processes to gain access to a facility such as a data center or office building.

- Can you open a door in an unintended way?
- Can you tailgate someone into the data center?
- Can you crawl through a vent?

> `Social engineering` pentesters test human beings.

- Can employees be fooled by phishing, vishing (phishing over the phone), or other scams?
- Can a social engineering pentester walk up to a receptionist and say, "yes, I work here?"
