- A `Vulnerability Assessment` aims to identify and categorize risks for security weaknesses related to assets within an environment. It is important to note that `there is little to no manual exploitation during a vulnerability assessment`. A vulnerability assessment also provides remediation steps to fix the issues.

### Methodology :

## Understanding Key Terms :

### Vulnerability:
-  `Vulnerability` is a weakness or bug in an organization's environment, including applications, networks, and infrastructure, that opens up the possibility of threats from external actors.

### Threat :
- A `Threat` is a process that amplifies the potential of an adverse event, such as a threat actor exploiting a vulnerability. Some vulnerabilities raise more threat concerns over others due to the probability of the vulnerability being exploited. For example, the higher the reward of the outcome and ease of exploitation, the more likely the issue would be exploited by threat actors.
### Exploit :
- An `Exploit` is any code or resources that can be used to take advantage of an asset's weakness. Many exploits are available through open-source platforms such as [Exploitdb](https://exploitdb.com/) or [the Rapid7 Vulnerability and Exploit Database](https://www.rapid7.com/db/). We will often see exploit code hosted on sites such as GitHub and GitLab as well .
### Risk :
- `Risk` is the possibility of assets or data being harmed or destroyed by threat actors.
![What is Risk?](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/108/graphics/whatisrisk.png)

To differentiate the three, we can think of it as follows:

- `Risk`: something bad that could happen
- `Threat`: something bad that is happening
- `Vulnerabilities`: weaknesses that could lead to a threat
