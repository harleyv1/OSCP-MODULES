- `Network File System` (`NFS`) is a network file system developed by Sun Microsystems and has the same purpose as SMB. Its purpose is to access file systems over a network as if they were local. However, it uses an entirely different protocol. [NFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_File_System) is used between Linux and Unix systems. This means that NFS clients cannot communicate directly with SMB servers. NFS is an Internet standard that governs the procedures in a distributed file system. While NFS protocol version 3.0 (`NFSv3`), which has been in use for many years, authenticates the client computer, this changes with `NFSv4`. Here, as with the Windows SMB protocol, the user must authenticate.

- NFS is based on the [Open Network Computing Remote Procedure Call](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_RPC) (`ONC-RPC`/`SUN-RPC`) protocol exposed on `TCP` and `UDP` ports `111`, which uses [External Data Representation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_Data_Representation) (`XDR`) for the system-independent exchange of data. The NFS protocol has `no` mechanism for `authentication` or `authorization`.

### Default Configuration :
- NFS is not difficult to configure because there are not as many options as FTP or SMB have. The `/etc/exports` file contains a table of physical filesystems on an NFS server accessible by the clients. The [NFS Exports Table](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/trusty/man5/exports.5.html) shows which options it accepts and thus indicates which options are available to us.
#### Exports File :
```shell
Pwn1Sec@htb[/htb]$ cat /etc/exports 

# /etc/exports: the access control list for filesystems which may be exported
#               to NFS clients.  See exports(5).
#
# Example for NFSv2 and NFSv3:
# /srv/homes       hostname1(rw,sync,no_subtree_check) hostname2(ro,sync,no_subtree_check)
#
# Example for NFSv4:
# /srv/nfs4        gss/krb5i(rw,sync,fsid=0,crossmnt,no_subtree_check)
# /srv/nfs4/homes  gss/krb5i(rw,sync,no_subtree_check)
```

|**Option**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`rw`|Read and write permissions.|
|`ro`|Read only permissions.|
|`sync`|Synchronous data transfer. (A bit slower)|
|`async`|Asynchronous data transfer. (A bit faster)|
|`secure`|Ports above 1024 will not be used.|
|`insecure`|Ports above 1024 will be used.|
|`no_subtree_check`|This option disables the checking of subdirectory trees.|
|`root_squash`|Assigns all permissions to files of root UID/GID 0 to the UID/GID of anonymous, which prevents `root` from accessing files on an NFS mount.|

#### ExportFS :
```shell
root@nfs:~# echo '/mnt/nfs  10.129.14.0/24(sync,no_subtree_check)' >> /etc/exports
root@nfs:~# systemctl restart nfs-kernel-server 
root@nfs:~# exportfs

/mnt/nfs      	10.129.14.0/24
```

> We have shared the folder `/mnt/nfs` to the subnet `10.129.14.0/24` with the setting shown above. This means that all hosts on the network will be able to mount this NFS share and inspect the contents of this folder.

### Dangerous Settings :
- However, even with NFS, some settings can be dangerous for the company and its infrastructure. Here are some of them listed:

|**Option**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`rw`|Read and write permissions.|
|`insecure`|Ports above 1024 will be used.|
|`nohide`|If another file system was mounted below an exported directory, this directory is exported by its own exports entry.|
|`no_root_squash`|All files created by root are kept with the UID/GID 0.|

# Footprinting the Service :

- When footprinting NFS, the TCP ports `111` and `2049` are essential. We can also get information about the NFS service and the host via RPC, as shown below in the example.
#### Nmap :
```shell
Pwn1Sec@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap 10.129.14.128 -p111,2049 -sV -sC

- The `rpcinfo` NSE script retrieves a list of all currently running RPC services, their names and descriptions, and the ports they use. This lets us check whether the target share is connected to the network on all required ports. Also, for NFS, Nmap has some NSE scripts that can be used for the scans. These can then show us, for example, the `contents` of the share and its `stats`.
