### Definision :
- `Domain Name System` (`DNS`) is an integral part of the Internet. For example, through domain names, such as [academy.hackthebox.com](https://academy.hackthebox.com/) or [www.hackthebox.com](https://www.hackthebox.eu/), we can reach the web servers that the hosting provider has assigned one or more specific IP addresses. DNS is a system for resolving computer names into IP addresses, and it does not have a central database. Simplified, we can imagine it like a library with many different phone books.

|**Server Type**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`DNS Root Server`|The root servers of the DNS are responsible for the top-level domains (`TLD`). As the last instance, they are only requested if the name server does not respond. Thus, a root server is a central interface between users and content on the Internet, as it links domain and IP address. The [Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers](https://www.icann.org/) (`ICANN`) coordinates the work of the root name servers. There are `13` such root servers around the globe.|
|`Authoritative Nameserver`|Authoritative name servers hold authority for a particular zone. They only answer queries from their area of responsibility, and their information is binding. If an authoritative name server cannot answer a client's query, the root name server takes over at that point.|
|`Non-authoritative Nameserver`|Non-authoritative name servers are not responsible for a particular DNS zone. Instead, they collect information on specific DNS zones themselves, which is done using recursive or iterative DNS querying.|
|`Caching DNS Server`|Caching DNS servers cache information from other name servers for a specified period. The authoritative name server determines the duration of this storage.|
|`Forwarding Server`|Forwarding servers perform only one function: they forward DNS queries to another DNS server.|
|`Resolver`|Resolvers are not authoritative DNS servers but perform name resolution locally in the computer or router.|

|**DNS Record**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`A`|Returns an IPv4 address of the requested domain as a result.|
|`AAAA`|Returns an IPv6 address of the requested domain.|
|`MX`|Returns the responsible mail servers as a result.|
|`NS`|Returns the DNS servers (nameservers) of the domain.|
|`TXT`|This record can contain various information. The all-rounder can be used, e.g., to validate the Google Search Console or validate SSL certificates. In addition, SPF and DMARC entries are set to validate mail traffic and protect it from spam.|
|`CNAME`|This record serves as an alias. If the domain www.hackthebox.eu should point to the same IP, and we create an A record for one and a CNAME record for the other.|
|`PTR`|The PTR record works the other way around (reverse lookup). It converts IP addresses into valid domain names.|
|`SOA`|Provides information about the corresponding DNS zone and email address of the administrative contact.|

### Default Configuration :
> There are many different configuration types for DNS. Therefore, we will only discuss the most important ones to illustrate better the functional principle from an administrative point of view. All DNS servers work with three different types of configuration files:

1. local DNS configuration files
2. zone files
3. reverse name resolution files

> The DNS server [Bind9](https://www.isc.org/bind/) is very often used on Linux-based distributions. Its local configuration file (`named.conf`) is roughly divided into two sections, firstly the options section for general settings and secondly the zone entries for the individual domains. The local configuration files are usually:

- `named.conf.local`
- `named.conf.options`
- `named.conf.log`

### Dangerous Settings :
- There are many ways in which a DNS server can be attacked. For example, a list of vulnerabilities targeting the BIND9 server can be found at [CVEdetails](https://www.cvedetails.com/product/144/ISC-Bind.html?vendor_id=64). In addition, SecurityTrails provides a short [list](https://securitytrails.com/blog/most-popular-types-dns-attacks) of the most popular attacks on DNS servers.

- Some of the settings we can see below lead to these vulnerabilities, among others. Because DNS can get very complicated and it is very easy for errors to creep into this service, forcing an administrator to work around the problem until they find an exact solution. This often leads to elements being released so that parts of the infrastructure function as planned and desired. In such cases, functionality has a higher priority than security, which leads to misconfigurations and vulnerabilities.

|**Option**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`allow-query`|Defines which hosts are allowed to send requests to the DNS server.|
|`allow-recursion`|Defines which hosts are allowed to send recursive requests to the DNS server.|
|`allow-transfer`|Defines which hosts are allowed to receive zone transfers from the DNS server.|
|`zone-statistics`|Collects statistical data of zones.|

- For the IP address to be resolved from the `Fully Qualified Domain Name` (`FQDN`), the DNS server must have a reverse lookup file. In this file, the computer name (FQDN) is assigned to the last octet of an IP address, which corresponds to the respective host, using a `PTR` record. The PTR records are responsible for the reverse translation of IP addresses into names, as we have already seen in the above table.
