# Footprinting the Service :

- There are many reasons why a MySQL server could be accessed from an external network. Nevertheless, it is far from being one of the best practices, and we can always find databases that we can reach. Often, these settings were only meant to be temporary but were forgotten by the administrators. This server setup could also be used as a workaround due to a technical problem. Usually, the MySQL server runs on `TCP port 3306`, and we can scan this port with `Nmap` to get more detailed information.

#### Scanning MySQL Server :
```shell
Pwn1Sec@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap 10.129.14.128 -sV -sC -p3306 --script mysql*

Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2021-09-21 00:53 CEST

```

As with all our scans, we must be careful with the results and manually confirm the information obtained because some of the information might turn out to be a false-positive. This scan above is an excellent example of this, as we know for a fact that the target MySQL server does not use an empty password for the user `root`, but a fixed password. We can test this with the following command:

#### Interaction with the MySQL Server :
```shell
Pwn1Sec@htb[/htb]$ mysql -u root -h 10.129.14.132

ERROR 1045 (28000): Access denied for user 'root'@'10.129.14.1' (using password: NO)
```

- For example, if we use a password that we have guessed or found through our research, we will be able to log in to the MySQL server and execute some commands.

```shell
Pwn1Sec@htb[/htb]$ mysql -u root -pP4SSw0rd -h 10.129.14.128

 - If we look at the existing databases, we will see several already exist. The most important databases for the MySQL server are the `system schema` (`sys`) and `information schema` (`information_schema`). The system schema contains tables, information, and metadata necessary for management. More about this database can be found in the [reference manual](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/system-schema.html#:~:text=The%20mysql%20schema%20is%20the,used%20for%20other%20operational%20purposes) of MySQL.
