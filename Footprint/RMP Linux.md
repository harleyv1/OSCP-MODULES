[Secure Shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell) (`SSH`) enables two computers to establish an encrypted and direct connection within a possibly insecure network on the standard port `TCP 22`.

Therefore, we need to connect to it using the SSH protocol and authenticate ourselves to it. In total, OpenSSH has six different authentication methods:

1. Password authentication
2. Public-key authentication
3. Host-based authentication
4. Keyboard authentication
5. Challenge-response authentication
6. GSSAPI authentication

#### Public Key Authentication :
- In a first step, the SSH server and client authenticate themselves to each other. The server sends a certificate to the client to verify that it is the correct server. Only when contact is first established is there a risk of a third party interposing itself between the two participants and thus intercepting the connection. Since the certificate itself is also encrypted, it cannot be imitated. Once the client knows the correct certificate, no one else can pretend to make contact via the corresponding server.
### Default Configuration :
```shell
Pwn1Sec@htb[/htb]$ cat /etc/ssh/sshd_config  | grep -v "#" | sed -r '/^\s*$/d'

Include /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/*.conf
ChallengeResponseAuthentication no
UsePAM yes
X11Forwarding yes
PrintMotd no
AcceptEnv LANG LC_*
Subsystem       sftp    /usr/lib/openssh/sftp-server
```

### Dangerous Settings :
|**Setting**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`PasswordAuthentication yes`|Allows password-based authentication.|
|`PermitEmptyPasswords yes`|Allows the use of empty passwords.|
|`PermitRootLogin yes`|Allows to log in as the root user.|
|`Protocol 1`|Uses an outdated version of encryption.|
|`X11Forwarding yes`|Allows X11 forwarding for GUI applications.|
|`AllowTcpForwarding yes`|Allows forwarding of TCP ports.|
|`PermitTunnel`|Allows tunneling.|
|`DebianBanner yes`|Displays a specific banner when logging in.|

#### Change Authentication Method :
```shell
Pwn1Sec@htb[/htb]$ ssh -v cry0l1t3@10.129.14.132

OpenSSH_8.2p1 Ubuntu-4ubuntu0.3, OpenSSL 1.1.1f  31 Mar 2020
debug1: Reading configuration data /etc/ssh/ssh_config 
...SNIP...
debug1: Authentications that can continue: publickey,password,keyboard-interactive
```

- For potential brute-force attacks, we can specify the authentication method with the SSH client option `PreferredAuthentications`.

```shell
Pwn1Sec@htb[/htb]$ ssh -v cry0l1t3@10.129.14.132 -o PreferredAuthentications=password

OpenSSH_8.2p1 Ubuntu-4ubuntu0.3, OpenSSL 1.1.1f  31 Mar 2020
debug1: Reading configuration data /etc/ssh/ssh_config
...SNIP...
debug1: Authentications that can continue: publickey,password,keyboard-interactive
debug1: Next authentication method: password

cry0l1t3@10.129.14.132's password:

#### Scanning for Rsync :
```shell
Pwn1Sec@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap -sV -p 873 127.0.0.1

Starting Nmap 7.92 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2022-09-19 09:31 EDT
Nmap scan report for localhost (127.0.0.1)
Host is up (0.0058s latency).

PORT    STATE SERVICE VERSION
873/tcp open  rsync   (protocol version 31)

Service detection performed. Please report any incorrect results at https://nmap.org/submit/ .
Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 1.13 seconds
```

#### Probing for Accessible Shares :
```shell
Pwn1Sec@htb[/htb]$ nc -nv 127.0.0.1 873

(UNKNOWN) [127.0.0.1] 873 (rsync) open
@RSYNCD: 31.0
@RSYNCD: 31.0
#list

@RSYNCD: EXIT
```

#### Enumerating an Open Share :
```shell
Pwn1Sec@htb[/htb]$ rsync -av --list-only rsync://127.0.0.1/dev

receiving incremental file list
drwxr-xr-x             48 2022/09/19 09:43:10 .
-rw-r--r--              0 2022/09/19 09:34:50 build.sh
-rw-r--r--              0 2022/09/19 09:36:02 secrets.yaml
drwx------             54 2022/09/19 09:43:10 .ssh

sent 25 bytes  received 221 bytes  492.00 bytes/sec
total size is 0  speedup is 0.00
```

- From the above output, we can see a few interesting files that may be worth pulling down to investigate further. We can also see that a directory likely containing SSH keys is accessible. From here, we could sync all files to our attack host with the command `rsync -av rsync://127.0.0.1/dev`. If Rsync is configured to use SSH to transfer files, we could modify our commands to include the `-e ssh` flag, or `-e "ssh -p2222"` if a non-standard port is in use for SSH. This [guide](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/how-to-rsync-over-ssh) is helpful for understanding the syntax for using Rsync over SSH.

### R-Services :
The [R-commands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_r-commands) suite consists of the following programs:

- rcp (`remote copy`)
- rexec (`remote execution`)
- rlogin (`remote login`)
- rsh (`remote shell`)
- rstat
- ruptime
- rwho (`remote who`)

|**Command**|**Service Daemon**|**Port**|**Transport Protocol**|**Description**|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|`rcp`|`rshd`|514|TCP|Copy a file or directory bidirectionally from the local system to the remote system (or vice versa) or from one remote system to another. It works like the `cp` command on Linux but provides `no warning to the user for overwriting existing files on a system`.|
|`rsh`|`rshd`|514|TCP|Opens a shell on a remote machine without a login procedure. Relies upon the trusted entries in the `/etc/hosts.equiv` and `.rhosts` files for validation.|
|`rexec`|`rexecd`|512|TCP|Enables a user to run shell commands on a remote machine. Requires authentication through the use of a `username` and `password` through an unencrypted network socket. Authentication is overridden by the trusted entries in the `/etc/hosts.equiv` and `.rhosts` files.|
|`rlogin`|`rlogind`|513|TCP|Enables a user to log in to a remote host over the network. It works similarly to `telnet` but can only connect to Unix-like hosts. Authentication is overridden by the trusted entries in the `/etc/hosts.equiv` and `.rhosts` files.|

- The /etc/hosts.equiv file contains a list of trusted hosts and is used to grant access to other systems on the network. When users on one of these hosts attempt to access the system, they are automatically granted access without further authentication.

#### /etc/hosts.equiv :
```shell
Pwn1Sec@htb[/htb]$ cat /etc/hosts.equiv

# <hostname> <local username>
pwnbox cry0l1t3
```

- Now that we have a basic understanding of `r-commands`, let's do some quick footprinting using `Nmap` to determine if all necessary ports are open.

#### Scanning for R-Services
```shell
Pwn1Sec@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap -sV -p 512,513,514 10.0.17.2

Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2022-12-02 15:02 EST
Nmap scan report for 10.0.17.2
Host is up (0.11s latency).

PORT    STATE SERVICE    VERSION
512/tcp open  exec?
513/tcp open  login?
514/tcp open  tcpwrapped

Service detection performed. Please report any incorrect results at https://nmap.org/submit/ .
Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 145.54 seconds
```

 The `hosts.equiv` file is recognized as the global configuration regarding all users on a system, whereas `.rhosts` provides a per-user configuration.

#### Sample .rhosts File :
```shell
Pwn1Sec@htb[/htb]$ cat .rhosts

htb-student     10.0.17.5
+               10.0.17.10
+               +
```

#### Logging in Using Rlogin :
```shell
Pwn1Sec@htb[/htb]$ rlogin 10.0.17.2 -l htb-student

Last login: Fri Dec  2 16:11:21 from localhost

[htb-student@localhost ~]$
```

#### Listing Authenticated Users Using Rwho :
```shell
Pwn1Sec@htb[/htb]$ rwho

root     web01:pts/0 Dec  2 21:34
htb-student     workstn01:tty1  Dec  2 19:57  2:25   
```

#### Listing Authenticated Users Using Rusers :
```shell
Pwn1Sec@htb[/htb]$ rusers -al 10.0.17.5

htb-student     10.0.17.5:console          Dec 2 19:57     2:25
```
