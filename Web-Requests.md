## URL
+ Resources over HTTP are accessed via a `URL`, which offers many more specifications than simply specifying a website we want to visit. Let's look at the structure of a URL: ![url_structure](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/35/url_structure.png)
## HTTP Flow

![HTTP_Flow](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/35/HTTP_Flow.png)

+ The diagram above presents the anatomy of an HTTP request at a very high level. The first time a user enters the URL (`inlanefreight.com`) into the browser, it sends a request to a DNS (Domain Name Resolution) server to resolve the domain and get its IP. The DNS server looks up the IP address for `inlanefreight.com` and returns it. All domain names need to be resolved this way, as a server can't communicate without an IP address.
## HTTPS Flow
+ Let's look at how HTTPS operates at a high level: ![HTTPS_Flow](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/35/HTTPS_Flow.png)
If we type `http://` instead of `https://` to visit a website that enforces HTTPS, the browser attempts to resolve the domain and redirects the user to the webserver hosting the target website. A request is sent to port `80` first, which is the unencrypted HTTP protocol. The server detects this and redirects the client to secure HTTPS port `443` instead. This is done via the `301 Moved Permanently` response code, which we will discuss in an upcoming section.

## HTTP Request
+ Let's start by examining the following example HTTP request:
![raw_request](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/35/raw_request.png)

The image above shows an HTTP GET request to the URL:
>`http://inlanefreight.com/users/login.html`
> The first line of any HTTP request contains three main fields 'separated by spaces':

|**Field**|**Example**|**Description**|
|---|---|---|
|`Method`|`GET`|The HTTP method or verb, which specifies the type of action to perform.|
|`Path`|`/users/login.html`|The path to the resource being accessed. This field can also be suffixed with a query string (e.g. `?username=user`).|
|`Version`|`HTTP/1.1`|The third and final field is used to denote the HTTP version.|

## HTTP Response
+ Once the server processes our request, it sends its response. The following is an example HTTP response:
![raw_response](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/35/raw_response.png)

+ The first line of an HTTP response contains two fields separated by spaces. The first being the `HTTP version` (e.g. `HTTP/1.1`), and the second denotes the `HTTP response code` (e.g. `200 OK`).


>The following are some of the commonly seen examples from each of the above HTTP method types:

|**Code**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`200 OK`|Returned on a successful request, and the response body usually contains the requested resource.|
|`302 Found`|Redirects the client to another URL. For example, redirecting the user to their dashboard after a successful login.|
|`400 Bad Request`|Returned on encountering malformed requests such as requests with missing line terminators.|
|`403 Forbidden`|Signifies that the client doesn't have appropriate access to the resource. It can also be returned when the server detects malicious input from the user.|
|`404 Not Found`|Returned when the client requests a resource that doesn't exist on the server.|
|`500 Internal Server Error`|Returned when the server cannot process the request.|

## CRUD
>As we can see, we can easily specify the table and the row we want to perform an operation on through such APIs. Then we may utilize different HTTP methods to perform different operations on that row. In general, APIs perform 4 main operations on the requested database entity:

|Operation|HTTP Method|Description|
|---|---|---|
|`Create`|`POST`|Adds the specified data to the database table|
|`Read`|`GET`|Reads the specified entity from the database table|
|`Update`|`PUT`|Updates the data of the specified database table|
|`Delete`|`DELETE`|Removes the specified row from the database table|
